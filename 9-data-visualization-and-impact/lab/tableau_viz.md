# DASHBOARD BEST PRACTICES

#### When data is badly scale or lots of anomalies, try to use area composition chart
 - quick table calculation using percent of total
 - compute using table down of calculated field

#### if too many distinct values too show, only show top significant value instead
 - also can used calculated field to aggregate 'similar' item

#### hide field labels in the dashboard
 - right click at left top (field name)

#### make your dashboard, so then you will be using it more

#### annotation for storytelling
 - put annotation at top line questions / total aggregates chart

#### execs dashboard shouldn't have interactivity, keep it simple
