# DATA VISUALIZATION AND IMPACT

#### The Types of Impact You Can Have as a Data Engineer
- Measurable
    - Efficiency improvements and experimentation outcomes
- Hard-to-measure
    - Quality improvements, enables team
    - Nothing going wrong is the measurement
    - But this is not worth of your time to measure all quality error
    - Could also mean more quality errors mean higher quality since you catch more bugs
    - This is why this falls into hard-to-measure
    - Enables team - Things that solves a lot of headache for the team
- Immeasurable
    - Changing intuitions, team culture improvements, being a 'glue' person
    - Changing intuitions - When you present your data, then decision is made, but this is hard to measure unless need to be in the leadership position
    - 'Glue' person - Get everyone on the same page, one that hold the team together, the value is in the collaboration model, eventually this person is easier to be promoted as a leader

#### How Does Your as a Data Engineer Translate into Value?
- Supplying insights
    - Low quality data means more people will use their intuition more, and their intuition often likely is more wrong than right
- Preventing bugs and maintaining data trust
    - Provide core reviews that helps people adopt best practices
- Increasing pipeline efficiencies
- Enabling other engineers to work faster
    - Build framework that reduce friction and makes team faces less error
- Persuading decision makers to use data

#### When is an Insight Valuable?
- Insights do one of three things:
    - Reinforce intuitions
    - Contradict intuitions
    - Fail to support or contradict intuitions
- Supplying insights is often OVERVALUED

#### How to Know When Your Organization is Overvaluing Insights?
- A 'crisis' happens
- You start feeling burn out
- Long-term planning disappears
    - Stakeholder might get impatient when there is crisis and asks you data to answer questions, you data will be low quality then
- Ad hoc request hell
    - So many requests, you don't know which one is more important and to be fulfilled
- The rate of which you creates insights comes at a tradeoff with the rate of you creates error/technical debt
    - Be in a mindset that if you want to create it, make sure that it stick around for a long time
- This crisis eventually will passed, and don't take it personally

#### How Do You Push Back When Insights Are Overvalued?
- Don't be afraid to say no
    - Say that you are doing things as quickly as possible while maintaining quality
- Leverage your manager for support
    - If not, find a new job
- Communicate that robust data models are better than one-off pipelines!

#### How do You Maintain Trust in Data Sets You Produce?
- Quality checks
- Documentation
- Good engineering practices
- Clear expectation (SLA, documented gaps)
    - Make sure people have an expectation of when data will be arrive
    - Gaps in this context is edge cases, or rare events
- These type of value is often UNDERVALUED because it is harder to measure

#### How Do You Increase Pipeline Efficiencies?
1. Proper data modelling
2. Improving oncall processes
3. Reducing data volumes
4. Picking the right tool for the job (eg migration)
5. Simplifying model and reducing capabilities (think 80/20 rule)
